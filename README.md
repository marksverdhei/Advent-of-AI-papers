# Advent-of-AI-papers  

Papers are linked / listed below, but you can find their PDF versions in the `/pdfs/` directory in this repository.

All papers are discussed in the [NLP Norge discord server](https://discord.gg/cNn3HqRD) 

This repo serves as an advent calendar for research papers in AI and NLP

This is an advent calendar reading list for each day of Advent, 1 through 24.
I will add a paper, one day at a time.
